# An *in progress* boilerplate for static projects

My basic settings to start a new static project. Highly inspired on:

* [H5PB](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Pikselkraft npm scripts](https://github.com/pikselkraft/npm-scripts-boilerplate-XL)

## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dist` that will create dist folder and copy src files 
4. Run `npm run watch` to notice changes on assets
5. Run `npm run browsersync` to enable localhost/refresh at any change

## Features

Includes:
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) & [CSSNext](http://cssnext.io/) 
* Possibility to optmize css using uncss
* Possibility to generate Critical CSS inline
* Useful CSS helper classes. [H5BP]
* An optimized version of the Google Universal Analytics snippet. [H5PB]

** TODO
